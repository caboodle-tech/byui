                        In this assignment we want to dive further into what flexbox and grid are an what they are not. Below are the links to the Mozilla Developers Network Web Docs (MDN Web Docs) pages for flexbox and grid. Please give these a quick review, you do not need to read everything here.

                        CSS-Tricks is an awesome tech blog that started its life posting about CSS tricks for cross-browser design. In the past various web browsers often displayed the same web designs in very different ways. Developers and designers had to add extra code to insure their designs looked and operated the same cross-browser. This problem, well substantially reduced today, still exists. The CSS-Tricks website has evolved to cover many topics and I would recommend them to you as another resource for software development and web design.
